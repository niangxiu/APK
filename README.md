# Adjoint path-kernel algorithm 

An adjoint Monte-Carlo-type algorithm for computing the parameter-gradient of marginal and stationary distribution of random dynamical system and SDEs.
With this gradient tool, we can solve the variational data assimilation problem.
This code accompanies the paper: "Adjoint path-kernel method for backpropagation and data assimilation in unstable diffusions", Angxiu Ni.
